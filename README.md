# A Series of Untold Events

This mini autobio adventure game was built to be a future feature on my software developing portfolio website (currently in development). The game provides a sneak peak into untold events and odd elements from my childhood for viewers of my portfolio to enjoy.

There are 2 repositories needed to run this game: autobio-adventure & autobio-adventure-api. Please follow the getting started guide in each and run both of their servers at the same time.

Getting started:
```
npm install
npm start
